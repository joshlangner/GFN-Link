This dll needs to be placed next to your game executable in order to enable communication with the GRID backend.
### #GFNLinkSDK\include
C (.h) and C++ (.hpp) header files your application will need to include in order to access the GRIDLink API.
### GFNLinkSDK\lib
GFNLink static library files, built with various build configurations. 
- **GFNLinkMD.lib** - Uses MultiThreadedDll CRT linkage
- **GFNLinkMT.lib** - Uses MultiThreaded CRT linkage

### GFNLinkSDK\props
GFNLink props files to include in your application; Adding this will automatically set up include and lib paths.
- Use **GFNLinkSDK.props** if you're using MultiThreadedDll CRT linkage
- Use **GFNLinkSDKMT.props** if you're using MultiThreaded CRT linkage

### GFNLinkSDK\stubs
Stub files you can add to your application in order to meet the minimal integration requirements.
